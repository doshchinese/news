# NEWS
News is a frontend web app to get posts based on real-time full-text search for the HackerNews community site. Items are updated in real-time using official [HackerNews API] (https://github.com/HackerNews/API). Its API is built on top of Algolia Search's API. It enables developers to access HN data programmatically using a REST API. I built this app for leanring how to consume REST API.
